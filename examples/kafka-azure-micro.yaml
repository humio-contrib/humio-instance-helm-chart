    # divisible by number of zones

        # storage is sized for 1TB/day increase the storage to match the expected load

    #(total ingest uncompressed per day / 5 ) * 3 / ReplicaCount
    # ReplicaCount must be odd and greater than 3 should be divisible by AZ
    # Example: 1 TB/Day '1/5*3/3=205' 3 Replcias may not survive a zone failure at peak
    # Example:  1 TB/Day '1/5*3/6=103' 6 ensures at least one node per zone
    # 100 GB should be the smallest disk used for Kafka this may result in some waste
